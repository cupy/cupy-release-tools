cupy-release-tools
==================

Tools to automate the CuPy release process.
This tool is used to create both source distribution (``sdist``) and wheels.

The release process consists of 3 steps:

1. Build
2. Verify
3. Publish

Requirements
------------

Linux
~~~~~

* For ``sdist`` and CUDA (x86_64) wheel build, run the tool on Linux (x86_64). NVIDIA GPU + NVIDIA Container Toolkit are required for Verify step.
* For CUDA (aarch64) wheel build, run the tool on Linux (x86_64 with QEMU (aarch64), aarch64, or Tegra). NVIDIA GPU + NVIDIA Container Toolkit is required for Verify step.
* For ROCm wheel build, run the tool on Linux (x86_64). AMD GPU is required for Verify step.

Notes:

* To ensure the reproducibility of builds, the build environment is isolated by Docker.

Windows
~~~~~~~

* Windows 8+ (x86_64)
* Python, CUDA and Visual C++ are required. Versions depend on the target of the wheel.

Notes:

* Be aware that Windows tools in this repository is expected to be run on isolated virtual machine.
  Especially note that the tool directly installs the dependency libraries to ``%CUDA_PATH%``.
* ``sdist`` build on Windows is not supported.

Quick Guide
-----------

For Linux builds, you can use the ``build.sh`` shell script that wraps the Build and Verify steps.

::

  # Prepare source tree
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/cupy/cupy.git

  # Build & verify a sdist (using Python 3.10)
  ./build.sh sdist 3.10

  # Build & verify a wheel for CUDA 11.0 + Python 3.8
  ./build.sh 11.0 3.8

For Windows, or if you need some more detailed configuration, see the sections below to manually run the tool.

Build
-----

This tool can build wheels for Linux & Windows for supported CUDA/ROCm x Python variants defined in ``dist_config.py``.

Building Distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**IMPORTANT**: Always make sure to use a fresh, just-git-cloned CuPy source tree!

To build a sdist, use the following command.
``--source`` is a path to the source tree.

::

  ./dist.py --action build --target sdist --python 3.6.0 --source path/to/cupy_repo

To build a wheel, use the following command.
This example builds wheel of CuPy with CUDA 10.0 for Python 3.8.

::

  ./dist.py --action build --target wheel-linux --python 3.8 --cuda 10.0 --source path/to/cupy_repo

Use ``--target wheel-win`` for Windows build.
Use ``--cuda rocm-5.0`` for ROCm (AMD GPU) build.

The resulting asset (sdist/wheel) will be generated to the current directory.

Working Directory (Linux)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is safe to run multiple ``dist.py`` at a time.
Each time you run the tool, a dedicated temporary directory (``/tmp/cupy-dist-XXXXX``) is created.
The temporary directory is shared with the builder docker container as a volume.
The working directory will be removed after the build.

Verify
------

The tool can be used to confirm that the built distribution can work on multiple environments.

Verifying Distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the built distribution, use the following command:

::

  ./dist.py --action verify --target wheel-linux --python 3.8 --cuda 10.0 --dist cupy_cuda100-9.0.0b2-cp38-cp38-manylinux_x86_64.whl --test release-tests/common --test release-tests/cudnn --test release-tests/nccl

You can specify test suites directory to ``--test`` argument.
``release-tests`` is a minimal test cases handy for final check before release.
Of course, you can also run the full unit test suites from CuPy source tree.

Publish
-------

Use ``twine`` command to upload distributions.
